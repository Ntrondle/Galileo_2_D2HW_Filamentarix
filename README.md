### Galileo 2 Remix with Pre-Extruder Gear Filament Sensor

![Image](./images/picture1.png)

#### Description:
This is a remix of the [**Galileo 2 extruder**](https://github.com/JaredC01/Galileo2) by JaredC01, designed to integrate a **pre-extruder gear filament sensor** using the **Omron D2HW-C01 microswitch and MR63ZZ combo**, inspired by the ingenious [**Box Turtle**](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle) design by Armored Turtle. The addition of this sensor provides filament monitoring, while enhancing reliability as opposed to the D2H/5mm Ball bearing combo seen previously on other design...

This remix also modifies the geometry of the **Stealburner unit**, as the tight fit of the chosen microswitch required slight adjustments.

#### Features:
- Integration of a **pre-extruder gear filament sensor** for improved filament tracking.
- Enhanced operational stability for frequent tool changes, addressing known issues with Galileo's design.
- Slightly modified filament path to better accommodate the new sensor setup.

#### Bill of Materials (BOM):
- **1x Omron D2HW-C201H microswitch**
- **1x MR63ZZ bearing**
- **1x M3 Voron spec heat insert**
- **1x M3x10 SHCS screw**

#### Notes:
- Ensure proper alignment of the sensor with the filament path for accurate detection.
- Verify your printer's tuning before printing and assembling this modification.

#### Assembly:
The CAD files are included to guide the assembly process. Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged to further refine the design.
